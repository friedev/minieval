text = "Welcome to Minieval! Your goal is to earn as many victory points (VP) as you can in a limited number of turns. You can earn VP by placing buildings, but buildings cost gold (GP) to build. You can see your current GP and VP on the top left.

The GP and VP you earn from a building are affected by the buildings next to it. For example, placing a house next to a shop will earn you more GP, but placing 2 shops next to each other will cost you more GP due to competition.

Roads can be used to connect buildings that are otherwise out of range. Any buildings connected by a road will interact with ALL buildings on that same road network. These interactions only affect the GP you gain from the building, and NOT the VP.

Buildings can't be destroyed, but you can always press Z or U to undo your last move. You can also press Y or R to redo.

Good luck, and thanks for playing Minieval!"
