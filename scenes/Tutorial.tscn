You can see your current [color=#ffcc00]GP[/color] and [color=#00ccff]VP[/color] on the top left.

The [color=#ffcc00]GP[/color] and [color=#00ccff]VP[/color] you earn from a [color=#884400]building[/color] are affected by the [color=#884400]buildings[/color] next to it. For example, placing a [color=#884400]house[/color] next to a [color=#884400]shop[/color] will earn you more [color=#ffcc00]GP[/color], but placing 2 [color=#884400]shops[/color] next to each other will cost you more [color=#ffcc00]GP[/color] due to competition.

[color=#cc8800]Roads[/color] can be used to connect [color=#884400]buildings[/color] that are otherwise out of range.

These interactions only affect the [color=#ffcc00]GP[/color] you gain from the [color=#884400]building[/color], and [color=#ff0000]NOT[/color] the [color=#00ccff]VP[/color].

[color=#884400]Buildings[/color] can't be destroyed, but you can always press [color=#ff00ff]Z[/color] or [color=#ff00ff]U[/color] to undo your last move. You can also press [color=#ff00ff]Y[/color] or [color=#ff00ff]R[/color] to redo.
