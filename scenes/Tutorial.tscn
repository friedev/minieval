In this game, your goal is to earn as many [color=#00c0ff]Victory Points (VP)[/color] as you can in a limited number of turns, shown on the top right.

You can see your current [color=#ffc000]Currency[/color] and [color=#00c0ff]VP[/color] on the top left.

The [color=#ffc000]Currency[/color] and [color=#00c0ff]VP[/color] you earn from a [color=#804000]Building[/color] are affected by the [color=#804000]Buildings[/color] next to it. For example, placing a [color=#804000]House[/color] next to a [color=#804000]Shop[/color] will earn you more [color=#ffc000]Currency[/color] than placing them far apart. However, placing 2 [color=#804000]Shops[/color] next to each other will cost you more [color=#ffc000]Currency[/color] due to competition. The [color=#c0c0c0]Range[/color] of a [color=#804000]Building[/color] is shown with a [color=#c0c0c0]White[/color] highlight.

The total amount of [color=#ffc000]Currency[/color] and [color=#00c0ff]VP[/color] that you will gain or lose by placing a [color=#804000]Building[/color] is shown above it.

[color=#c08000]Roads[/color] can be used to connect [color=#804000]Buildings[/color] that are otherwise out of range. Any [color=#804000]Buildings[/color] connected by a [color=#c08000]Road[/color] will interact with ALL [color=#804000]Buildings[/color] on that same [color=#c08000]Road[/color] network. These interactions will only affect the [color=#ffc000]Currency[/color] you gain from the [color=#804000]Building[/color], and [color=#ff0000]NOT[/color] the [color=#00c0ff]VP[/color].

Use [color=#ff00ff]Left-Click[/color] to place a [color=#804000]Building[/color], [color=#ff00ff]WASD[/color] or [color=#ff00ff]Arrow Keys[/color] to pan, [color=#ff00ff]Scroll[/color] or [color=#ff00ff]QE[/color] to zoom, [color=#ff00ff]Z[/color] or [color=#ff00ff]U[/color] to undo, and [color=#ff00ff]Y[/color] or [color=#ff00ff]R[/color] to redo. [color=#ff00ff]Left-Click[/color] a [color=#804000]Building[/color] on the palette to select it, or press the [color=#ff00ff]Number Key[/color] corresponding to its position. Press [color=#ff00ff]Escape[/color] to open the menu, press [color=#ff00ff]I[/color] to show an info overlay with every interaction, and hold [color=#ff00ff]Shift[/color] to show some stats about your current run.

The Currency and VP you earn from a Building are affected by the Buildings next to it. For example, placing a House next to a Shop will earn you more Currency than placing them far apart.

Roads can be used to connect Buildings that are otherwise out of range. Any Buildings connected by a Road will interact with ALL Buildings on that same Road network. These interactions will only affect the Currency you gain from the Building, and NOT the VP.
