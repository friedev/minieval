# Minieval

A tiny medieval city builder, inspired by [Islanders](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1046030/ISLANDERS).

## How to Play

In Minieval, your goal is to earn as many victory points (VP) as you can in a limited number of turns, shown on the top right.
You can earn VP by placing buildings.
However, buildings cost gold (GP) to build.

The GP and VP you earn from a building are affected by the buildings next to it.
For example, placing a house next to a shop will earn you more GP than placing them far apart.
However, placing 2 shops next to each other will cost you more GP due to competition.
The range of a building is shown with a white highlight.
Positive interactions between buildings are highlighted in green, mixed interactions in yellow, and negative interactions in red.

Roads can be used to connect buildings that are otherwise out of range.
Any buildings connected by a road will interact with ALL buildings on that same road network.
These interactions will only affect the GP you gain from the building, and NOT the VP.
